# de-templater

An script that creates standard templates with boilerplate for common data transformation scenarios.

## Install

```
pip install --no-cache git+git://github.com/GSS-Cogs/de-templater.git#egg=detemplater
```

## Usage

The templater is command line callable, so to use:

* Navigate to a dataset directory (i.e at the same level as an individual dataset info.json)
* run `detemplate` on the command line.

_Note: It's worth looking through the source file and/or spec a bit before running the templater as it'll ask you a few questions about what you're looking to do._
